# Fetch a neofetch clone.

Fetch is a neofetch clone made by me in bash. I made this program to learn bash more in depth it's not practical but just a fun project.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Shaikh-Rehan-Shakil/fetch.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd src
```



Start the server

```bash
  bash fetch.sh
```
